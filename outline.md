## Description

This Web Application allows user to type in a city and get the current and five day weather for that city. This was accomplished using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Moment.js and open weather map's APIs. See [How To Use](#how-to-use) section for an explanation of how it works.

Overall a fun and challenging project. I came away with a better understanding of incorporating APIs into a website.

#### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Jquery
- APIs(moment.js, open weather map)
